// Read each line and log it
while (true) {

    // Read data
    let data = await socket.read({ until: '\n', format: 'utf8' })
    console.log(data)

}
```

```javascript
// Listen for incoming connections
let server = await TCPSocket.listen(8080)

// Send some text to each new client, then disconnect
while (true) {

    // Get new connection
